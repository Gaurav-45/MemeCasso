# MemeCasso Daemon Service

The **MemeCasso Daemon Service** powers the MemeCasso bot by continuously monitoring mentions on Bluesky. It processes mentions, generates memes by interacting with the backend API, and posts the generated memes back to the same threadâ€”all in real time.

## **How the Daemon Service Works**

1. **Monitoring Mentions**:

   - The daemon service runs continuously and checks for mentions every 1 minute.
   - It retrieves notifications/mentions from the Bluesky account.

2. **Processing Mentions**:

   - For each mention, it identifies the parent post where the bot was tagged.
   - The parent post content is sent to the backend API to generate a meme.

3. **Posting Meme Replies**:
   - Once the meme is generated, the service posts it as a reply in the same thread.
   - The notification is marked as "read" after processing, ensuring no duplication.
